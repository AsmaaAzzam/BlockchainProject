The Event Ticketing System is a blockchain-based application designed to manage the sale and distribution of event tickets. 
The system includes two main components: the Event and Ticket packages. The Event package handles event details such as the event ID, name, date, available tickets, and price. 
The Ticket package manages individual tickets, associating each ticket with an event and owner. 
The system leverages Hyperledger Fabric to securely track and manage tickets, ensuring transparency and security in ticket transactions.
